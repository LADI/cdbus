== cdbus - libdbus helper library (in plain C)

This library complements the API provided by https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/[libdbus]
so to ease libdbus interfacing in plain C code.

Before becoming a separate software module,
the code in this library was part of https://ladish.org/jackdbus.html[jackdbus],
a2jmidid, lash and https://ladish.org/[ladish].

The cdbus-codegen tool generates cdbus bindings from dbus xml files
