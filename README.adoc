== cdbus - libdbus helper library (in plain C)

.WORK IN PROGRESS
[NOTE]
This is Work In Progress of refactoring cdbus code that is currently
part of https://ladish.org/jackdbus.html[jackdbus], a2jmidid, lash and
https://ladish.org/[ladish] as a reusable software component.

This library complements the API provided by https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/[libdbus]
so to ease libdbus interfacing in plain C code.

Before becoming a separate software module,
the code in this library was part of https://ladish.org/jackdbus.html[jackdbus],
a2jmidid, lash and https://ladish.org/[ladish].
